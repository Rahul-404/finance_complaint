    "Example: i want to schedule my pipeline on weekly basis, i want it to trigger on weekly basis, we should have ETL pipline to gather data on weekly basis once the collection for week is done, the *training pipeline* should get triggered and training should start, so will be having $\\text{old data} + \\text{new data}$ both data will be combined and training should happen, if our newly trained model have more accuracy that existing one it should replace exixting one with new one (for this we have **Model Resolver**, it will able to locate the path of new model). will set our training pipeline on weekly basis, on every **sunday**, sunday is right time.\n",
    "\n",
    "In **ML Ops** $\\text{Code} + \\text{Data}$ goes in hand  in hand, if we change $\\text{Code}$ then we have to train the model and also if we change $\\text{Data}$ then again we have to train the model.\n",
